The ultimate guide to data cleaning involves a multi-step process:
- First, **profile** the data to identify errors like missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
- Second, **clean** the data by correcting or removing anomalies, filling gaps, standardizing formats, and fixing structural issues. 
- Third, **verify** the changes to ensure correctness and then **document** the entire process and results. 

## Step 1: Data profiling and inspection

- **Profile the data:** Analyze the dataset to understand its structure and identify potential problems.
- **Check for missing values:** Scan for empty or null entries in rows or columns.
- **Identify duplicates:** Find and count duplicate records to prevent inaccuracies.
- **Detect outliers:** Use visualizations or queries to find data points that are significantly different from the rest.
- **Spot inconsistencies:** Look for formatting errors, such as different casing for the same value (e.g., "USA" vs. "U.S.A."), and use queries to check for uniformity.
- **Validate data types:** Ensure that data is stored in the correct format (e.g., numbers as numbers, dates as dates). 

## Step 2: Data cleaning and correction

- **Handle missing values:** Decide whether to remove the rows or impute (fill in) the missing values with a suitable estimate.
- **Remove duplicates:** Filter out duplicate records to ensure data accuracy.
- **Standardize formats:** Fix inconsistencies by standardizing capitalization, units of measurement, and date formats.
- **Correct errors:** Fix spelling mistakes and other nonsensical values by using lookup tables or validation rules.
- **Restructure data:** Adjust the structure to ensure consistency, which may include splitting or merging columns.
- **Fix structural issues:** Correct any errors that make the data inconsistent, such as those in measurement or date formats. 

## Step 3: Verification and documentation
- **Verify changes:** After cleaning, inspect the data again to confirm that the corrections were applied correctly.

- **Document everything:** Keep a record of all the steps taken, the issues found, and the solutions applied.

- **Establish a plan:** Create a comprehensive data cleaning plan, define quality standards, and train your team on best practices.

- **Monitor and refine:** Continuously monitor data quality and refine your cleaning processes as needed.

  1. Data Cleaning

 

  Answer: **Data cleaning**

  The list in the image outlines key steps and concepts involved in **data cleaning**, which is the process of preparing data for analysis by removing or modifying incorrect, incomplete, irrelevant, or duplicate data. The points mentioned are all essential parts of this process:

  - **Remove duplicates**: Ensures data integrity and prevents models from being biased by repeated observations.
  - **Eliminate unnecessary data**: Focuses on keeping only relevant information, which can include using specific tools like a disk cleanup utility for general files.

  - **Text data cleaning**: Specifically addresses issues within textual data.
  - **Data transformation**: Modifies data into a suitable format for analysis.
  - **Accuracy**: A primary goal of the entire process, ensuring the data is correct and reliable.

    

  - **Implement routine data audits**: A best practice to maintain data quality over time.

  - The image displays a list of key steps involved in data cleansing or data quality management.
  Data standardization and fixing errors are crucial steps.
  Removing outliers and addressing missing data are part of the process.
  Correcting data at the source helps prevent future issues.
  Maintaining data integration ensures consistency across systems.

1. Data quality steps

Answer: **The image lists key steps and activities involved in the data quality and data cleaning process.**

These tasks are essential for ensuring data is accurate, consistent, and reliable for analysis or other uses.



- **Data validation:** Restricting the type or range of values that can be entered into a system to prevent errors at the source.

  

- **Clean the data:** The process of identifying and correcting or removing errors, inconsistencies, and incomplete entries in a dataset.

  

- **Create automated data quality reports:** Using scripts or dedicated tools to consistently monitor and report on data quality metrics over time.

  

- **Handle missing data:** Addressing incomplete entries through various methods like removal, imputation, or using specific tools.

  

- **Correct inaccuracies:** Fixing specific errors or inconsistencies found within the data.

  

- **Standardize data entry:** Ensuring uniform formats and rules for data across all entries to maintain consistency.
