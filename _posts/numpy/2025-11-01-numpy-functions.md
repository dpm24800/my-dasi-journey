 SN. | Functions | Descriptions |
---------|----------|--------- 
 1 | np.array() | Creates an array for which the elements are given by an array-like object, which, for example, can be a (nested) Python list, a tuple, an iterable sequence, or another ndarray instance.
 2 | np.zeros() | Creates an array with the specified dimensions and data type that is filled with zeros.
 3 | np.ones() | Creates an array with the specified dimensions and data type that is filled with ones.
 4 | np.diag() | Creates a diagonal array with specified values along the diagonal and zeros elsewhere.
 5 | np.arange() | Creates an array with evenly spaced values between the specified start, end, and increment values.
 6 | np.linspace() | Creates an array with evenly spaced values between specified start and end values, using a specified number of elements.
 3 | np.logspace() | Creates an array with values that are logarithmically spaced between the given start and end values.
 3 | np.meshgrid() | Generates coordinate matrices (and higher-dimensional coordinate arrays) from one-dimensional coordinate vectors.
 3 | np.fromfunction() | Creates an array and fills it with values specified by a given function, which is evaluated for each combination of indices for the given array size.
 3 | np.formfile() | Creates an array with the data from a binary (or text) file. NumPy also provides a corresponding function np.tofile with which NumPy arrays can be stored to disk and later read back using np.fromfile.
 3 | np.getfromtxt(), np.loadtxt() | Create an array from data read from a text file, for example, a commaseparated value (CSV) file. The function np.genfromtxt also supports data files with missing values.
 3 | np.random.rand() | Generates an array with random numbers that are uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. Other types of distributions are also available in the np. random module.
