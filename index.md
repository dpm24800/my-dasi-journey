# 🌿 The Path 

Welcome to my personal space — where the worlds of **Data, AI, and Dhamma** meet.  
This site reflects a journey of both **intellectual growth** and **inner understanding** — learning how the mind works, both through **machines** and **mindfulness**.

---

## 🧭 Introduction  

I document my ongoing exploration of **Data Science**, **Machine Learning**, and **Artificial Intelligence**, sharing structured notes, tutorials, and reflections from my daily learning.  

Alongside, I write about **Dhamma**, **mindfulness**, and **life lessons**, blending logic with wisdom — exploring how **clarity in thought** and **peace in mind** are deeply connected.

## ✨ Poetic Thought  

> “The mind is like a sky — vast, open, and clear.  
> Thoughts and emotions are clouds; they come and go,  
> but the sky remains unchanged.”
