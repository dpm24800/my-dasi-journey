Welcome to **My DS/AI Journey**

This blog is my personal space to document and share everything I learn on my path to becoming a **Data Scientist** and **Machine Learning Engineer**.  

Here, I explore concepts, experiments, and projects related to **Data Science**, **Machine Learning**, and **Artificial Intelligence** — from foundational math and Python programming to building real-world models and understanding modern AI systems.

### Why I Started This Blog
I believe that learning is most effective when shared.  
Writing about what I learn not only helps me remember it better but also allows others who are on a similar journey to benefit from it.  
This site serves as a **public learning journal** — a place to organize my notes, record my experiments, and track my growth over time.

### What You’ll Find Here
- Notes and tutorials on **Data Science, ML, and AI fundamentals**  
- Step-by-step **project walkthroughs**  
- Key ideas from books, papers, and courses  
- **Python code snippets** and implementation examples  
- Reflections on challenges and lessons learned  

### My Goal
To build a strong foundation in Data Science and Machine Learning,  
and eventually contribute to **AI solutions that make a real-world impact** — while staying curious, humble, and consistent in the process.
